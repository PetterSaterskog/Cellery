# direct measurements:
# immuneFraction
# cell sizes
# tumor size
#
# remaining unknowns:
# immune growth
# cancer-healthy diffusion
# immune-healthy diffusion
#
# observables to fit
# number of immune cells in tumor, both in center and perifery
# island size in tumor, both in center and perifery
# decay length of tumor border into healthy tissue
# island shapes, are tumor or immune cells the islands? Are they jagged or round?
#
# We need to fit three indep parameters, immune cell "growth" (recruitment) speed, cancer-healthy diffusion, immune-healthy diffussion.
# We have set the immune-cancer diffusion to 0 by hand since the immune-cancer border is practically of 0 width in the center, and we assume all cells of a certain type obey the same rules at all times.
#
# This is doubly overdetermined with 3 parameters, and ~6 observables. A successful fit thus indicates that our model is an effective description of the tumor dynamics.
